   Hello, my name is Xinyi Li. I am a sophomore major in computer science. I am the tutor for CS32 in F18 and
   it is my first time being a tutor. I took CS32 in S17, so I think I could still remember the course staff clearly. If you have
   any questions about the homework, labs or other course staff, feel free to ask me. I am happy to go through the course
   material. CS32 is my favorite lower-division CS course, because in this course, you can implement advanced projects which
   are challenging and exciting. After finishing labs in CS32, everything I had learned in CS16 and CS24 made more sense. So 
   I really like CS32's labs. They might be hard at the beginning, but you will definitely find they are interesting and  
   useful in the end. Outside school, I like surfing and traveling, but I have not got the chance to visit many places in 
   California yet. You can also come to me to talk about future classes, internships or projects. Feel free to reach me on 
   Piazza!!
