  <b> Sanjana Sahayaraj (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m Sanjana your TA this quarter. I did my undergrad in CS from India and am a graduate student in CS at UCSB now. My areas of research interest are health data science and natural language processing. If any of you are looking to get into or develop skills in these areas, you can drop in for a chat during my office hours. Other than research and academics, I also enjoy doing photography and cooking elaborate and authentic Indian dishes." </i>

    <b>Aiwen Xu (TA) </b>
    <i> Hello there! I am Aiwen, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science. I majored in both Mathematics and Computer Science during my undergraduate years at New York University Shanghai. In fact, I took my first computer science course in the second semester of sophomore year, so it’s quite amazing that I am starting a PhD two years later! Right now I work in Four Eyes Lab and my advisor is Tobias Hollerer. I am still exploring possible research directions, but since I have background in machine learning and human-computer interaction during my undergrad, I will probably do something related to those. When I am not working, I enjoy reading, mostly fictions (sci-fi especially) and some philosophy and mathematics as well. Feel free to talk to me about the course, how to get involved in research, and other things on your mind! Feel free to visit my personal website: </i> <a href="https://aiwenxu.netlify.com/">https://aiwenxu.netlify.com/</a>

  <b> Carly Larsson (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Salutations and welcome to CS 32. In the coming weeks we will both be learning something new: I will be tutoring CS 32 for the first time, and you all will be taking CS 32. I hope we can work together, and get as much computer science knowledge into our brains as possible. Currently I’m a forth year CCS CS student, also enrolled in the MS/BS program. I’m the Treasurer for the Society of Women Engineers (S.W.E) and would love to recruit some new computer scientists! The last two summers I interned as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. If you have questions about computer science, CS 32, internships, or S.W.E. please reach out to me at carly@umail.ucsb.edu." </i>

  <b> Xinyi Li (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hello, my name is Xinyi Li. I am a sophomore major in computer science. I am the tutor for CS32 in F18 and it is my first time being a tutor. I took CS32 in S17, so I think I could still remember the course staff clearly. If you have any questions about the homework, labs or other course staff, feel free to ask me. I am happy to go through the course material. CS32 is my favorite lower-division CS course, because in this course, you can implement advanced projects which are challenging and exciting. After finishing labs in CS32, everything I had learned in CS16 and CS24 made more sense. So I really like CS32's labs. They might be hard at the beginning, but you will definitely find they are interesting and useful in the end. Outside school, I like surfing and traveling, but I have not got the chance to visit many places in California yet. You can also come to me to talk about future classes, internships or projects. Feel free to reach me on Piazza!!" </i>

  <b> Arielle Robles (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Arielle Robles (she/her/hers) and I am a fourth year CS student. I transferred to the CS major during my second year, and I joined the undergraduate mentoring program last winter. I am eager to help students be successful in this course and also to answer any questions that may be unrelated to the material as well. During my time at UCSB I studied abroad in Scotland and took courses for my major. I also have had an software engineering internship and can help answer some questions you might have about the interview process and how to find internships! Outside of CS, I enjoy photography, being outdoors, and traveling." </i>
